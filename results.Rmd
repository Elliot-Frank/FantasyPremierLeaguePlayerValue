## Player Value Using Total Points & Cost

The first way we approached the task of determining whether a soccer player is overvalued or undervalued was by looking at how many fantasy points a soccer player received in a season, how much the players cost and the ratio of the two. In our analysis, we regard undervalued soccer players as having high total points in a season and a low cost. Conversely, we define overvalued soccer players as having low total points in a season compared to their price. 

### Filtering Out Bench Players

Before we get started with this analysis, it is important to highlight the fact that we filtered out players who average less than 45 minutes of play time per game. We made this cut because we only wanted to consider players who are on the pitch for more than half of the game on average (a soccer match lasts 90 minutes). In the plot below, we see can see where this cutoff. While it appears that we are filtering out most of soccer players in the league, we want to emphasize that the players we are cutting have little value for our analysis because if they are averaging less than 45 minutes of game time, they are most certainly bench players or injured players. These type of players be of much value because they simply do not spend enough time playing on the pitch, which justifies our choice to cut them from the analysis. 

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
# Plotting Minutes Played
df_orig2 = df_orig
df_orig2$Cost <- as.numeric(df_orig$Cost)
df_orig2$TotalPoints <- as.numeric(df_orig$TotalPoints)
df_orig2$PointsLastRound <- as.numeric(df_orig$PointsLastRound)
df_orig2$MinutesPlayed <- as.numeric(df_orig$MinutesPlayed)

df_orig2$Week <- as.numeric(df_orig$Week)

player_histogram <- df_orig2 %>%
  filter((Week == 37 & Season %in% c(2017, 2018, 2020, 2021)) |
         (Week == 35 & Season == 2019)) %>%
  mutate(avg_min_played = MinutesPlayed/Week) %>%
  select(Surname, avg_min_played)

ggplot(player_histogram, aes(avg_min_played)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1 ) +

```

### Vizualizing The Problem

To understand relationship between the total points scored in a season and the soccer player cost, we have produced a scatter plot of the two variables. As can be seen from the graph, there is a positive correlation between total points and soccer player cost. This is expected as soccer players who score more points are more valuable, hence their cost should increase. However, there are large deviations from the correlation shown in the best fit line. If a soccer player lies above the best fit line, it shows that they have a high points per cost output and consequently are undervalued. Likewise, if a player lies below the best fit line, they have a low points per cost output and are overvalued. Therefore, moving forward our analysis will investigate if there are patterns which lead to players being above or below this best fit line. 

In the graph, there is no clear trend showing that the number of points a player scores in a season depends on the year. In other words, in further analysis we may assume that soccer player performance statistics are time-independent. Further, it must be noted that the 2019 analysis has been excluded from the plot as the final week of the season was missing from the data source (as discussed in the missing data analysis).  

A final point to add about the graph is the fact that the best fit line, calculated using a loess smoothing, shows the gradient is steeper before Â£6 million and shallower after. This indicates that there could be an element of diminishing reuturns of value when choosing more expensive soccer players.

  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Player Value By Position

Taking a more granular perspective, we divided the players into their 3 position categories: defenders (DEF), midfielders (MID) and forwards (FWD). We then investigated how the total points, player cost and ratio of the two varied by position. 

In the next graph, we see boxplots of total points, cost and points per cost for each position. In the boxplot of total points we see that forwards generally score the most points and defenders score the least, indicating that forwards are the most valuable and defenders the least. However, when looking at the cost boxplot, we see that defenders cost the least and forwards cost the most, suggesting that defenders could have the best value for money. In the third boxplot, we divide the total points by cost and find that these two opposing effects essentially cancel out as the median points per cost is roughly 18 points per million of pounds. 

Interestingly, we also notice that the variation of points per cost is largest for defenders and smallest for forwards. This implies that when choosing forwards, there is a smaller risk of the soccer player being overvalued and a smaller reward for the player being undervalued, while the reverse is true for defenders who have a larger risk and larger reward.

#### Key Indicators of Player Value By Position

**How Different Players Score Points**

From our analysis so far, we have found that the median point per cost does not vary much across position. We have also found that forwards are less likely to be undervalued but also less likely to be overvalues, while it is the opposite for defenders. With this in mind, our next question looks to identify what traits one should look for when determining the value of defenders, midfielders and forwards. 

In the parallel coordinates plot, we see that there are 3 distinct clusters for how soccer players score points and these clusters follow position categories. With defenders, we see that they score few points from goals and assists, but a lot of points from having clean sheets (a clean sheet occurs when a team does not concede a goal during a game). Looking at midfielders and forwards, we see that most of their points come from goals and assists. Moreover, in terms of clean sheets for midfielders, they get relatively few and for forwards they get zero points from clean sheets (which is explained as forwards cannot score points from clean sheets). Focusing on bonus points, we have no evidence suggesting that certain positions score more bonus points than others. This leads us to the conclusion that it is best to evaluate defenders based on clean sheets, while we should judge midfielders and forwards based on goals and assists. 

An interesting point to note is that the soccer players with the most points from goals scored are midfielders, differing from the expectation that forwards score the most points from goals. One explanation for this could be that when a forward scores a goal they receive 4 points, while midfielders receive 5. However, deeper analysis reveals that these midfield players are Salah, Mane and Son. It could be argued that these soccer players should be classified as forwards because they sometimes play the striker position. Hence, one could conclude that these top scoring players in terms of points from goals occur because the players are misclassified as midfielders rather than strikers and therefore receive 5 points per goal rather than 4. This indicates that a strategy to pick undervalued players is to pick players like Salah, Mane and Son who play as wingers/strikers but are classified as midfielders in the FPL game.

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
#Select Top 50 players in each position and the ways they scored points
pointCategories <- d %>%                                      
  arrange(desc(TotalPoints)) %>% 
  group_by(PositionsList) %>%
  slice(1:50) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(  "GoalsScoredPoints", "AssistPoints",  "CleanSheetPoints", "BonusPoints", "PositionsList")

#Parallel Coordinate Plot
ggparcoord(data = pointCategories, columns = 1:4, groupColumn = 5, scale = "globalminmax" , alphaLines = 0.6 , splineFactor = 4) +
  ggtitle("How The Top 50 Performing Players in Each Position Score Points") + 
  labs(y = "Global MinMax Feature Value", x = "Point Types") +
  labs(colour = "Position") +
  theme_light() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


**Why Selected By Percentage is Important **

Selected By Percentage describes the proportion of FPL users that have selected a certain soccer player in their team. For example, if the Selected By Percentage is 10% for soccer player X, this means that 10% of FPL users have chosen soccer player X for their team. To illustrate why this statistic is important, lets now assume player X has a Selected By Percentage of 95%. Whenever soccer player X plays, 95% of FPL players will receive the points player X scores. This reduces the value of picking player X in your team because whenever player X scores points, 95% of FPL players will benefit from these points. Therefore, a useful strategy to implement when building an FPL team is to try to choose soccer players with a low Selected By Percentage because if these soccer players score a lot of points, fewer FPL users will benefit from these points. 

As can be seen in the relative frequency histogram faceted by position, most soccer players have a Selected By Percentage of less than 20%, which is low. Therefore, in future analysis we do not have to worry about players having a high Selected By Percentage, which would reduce their value. 

Another thing to note in this graph is the fact that the majority of soccer players are defenders and midfielders, not forwards. This difference can be explained with the knowledge that a typical soccer lineup is 4-4-2, which means the team fields 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 forwards. Hence, we would expect there to be more defenders and midfielders than forwards in the dataset, as soccer lineups use more defenders and midfielders.

  xlab("Selected By %") +

  scale_color_colorblind() +
  ggtitle("Relavtive Frequency against Selected By Percentage") +

### Player Value By Team

In recent soccer history, the premier league has been dominated by a group of teams referred to as âThe Big Sixâ. The teams in "The Big Six" are Manchester City (MCI), Liverpool (LIV), Chelsea (CHE), Tottenham (TOT), Arsenal (ARS), and Manchester United (MUN).

These teams all have global name recognition, with millions of fans around the world, leading to huge payroll budgets. According to The Athletic, Manchester City will spend Â£430 million in the 2022-2023 season paying its players, followed by Chelsea (Â£343 million), Manchester United (Â£323 million), Liverpool (Â£314 million), Arsenal (Â£244 million), and Tottenham (Â£205 million). Meanwhile, the bottom tier teamsâ payroll budgets tend to hover between Â£10 - Â£50 million. With such market power to attract the best soccer talent, these teams use their deep pockets to stay at the top of the leaderboard.

Unsurprisingly, the best players are concentrated on these six teams. Given Cost in FPL is driven by performance, itâs no surprise that the highest Cost players in the FPL game are concentrated within the âBig Sixâ teams.

  ylab("Team") +

```


In the ridge graph above, we plotted the distribution of player fantasy âCostâ in the last week of the 2017 - 2021 seasons, because âCostâ in the last week reflects the playerâs performance over the course of the entire season. For clarity, we ordered the teams in the ridge graph by their record at the end of the 2021 season, with MCI finishing in first, and BUR finishing at the bottom. An important feature of the English Premier League is that the worst three teams are kicked out at the end of the season. While the top teams are competing to win the league, the bottom teams are fighting to avoid being demoted. For consistency, we chose to include only the teams which played in the league every year between 2017 and 2021.

What we see in the graph is reflective of reality, that the soccer players on the bottom of the bottom teams are mostly concentrated around a mean of 4 to 5 million, but as you climb up the board, the mean shifts to between 5 and 6 million, and the tails get longer and longer. 

Overall, we see that there is a clear association between teams with higher records and fantasy âCostâ of players on those teams. Given the winning teams are those that score more goals than their opponents, itâs not surprising that fantasy points, and thus âCostâ are concentrated on those teams.

While the previous ridge line plot clearly indicates that players on better teams âCostâ more in fantasy, we wanted to ask the question âIs the higher cost of players on winning teams justified in terms of producing fantasy points?â 

To find an answer, we grouped the 5 highest scoring players on each team in the 2021 season, and divided their total fantasy âCostsâ by the number of fantasy points they produced on a bar chart. Next, we did the same thing with each teamâs 6 to 10th highest scoring players.  Lastly, the teams are ordered from left to right in the place the team finished the 2021 season.

In looking at the Cost / Point ratio among top 5 players, most teams range around 1.5 to 2.5 million. Seeing that the green bars are pretty consistent across the top and middle of the pack, we conclude that fantasy users generally aren't willing to pay disproportionate  âCostâ for players on a Big Six team. There appears to be a mild increase towards the last 3 teams, which makes sense as the performance of their top players resulted in the team being kicked out of the league. 

Of course, there are a few major exceptions, which we find are the most interesting parts of the graph. Compared to its peers, Manchester Unitedâs (MUN) âCost / Pointsâ ratio is higher than any other team in the league. In examining the data, we found that this is largely driven by the underperformance of its key star players. For example, Crsitiano Ronaldo was traded to Manchester United last year, and was expected to make a huge impact. At 37 years old, and in his 20th season of playing professional soccer, he failed to perform as highly as expected. As such, his âCostâ was extremely high all season, but he produced few fantasy points to show for it. 

Overall, we believe the higher âCost / Pointsâ ratio teams indicate those which underperformed in the league relative to expectations. All 4 teams whose Top 5 player âCost / Pointsâ ratio exceeded 2.5 million (MUN, LEI, EVE, BUR), were expected to place higher than they did given their record in 2020 and the real life salary budget at the clubâs disposal. 

From this graph, we conclude two recommendations to users. First, there doesn't appear to be a premium on âCost / Pointsâ for players on better teams. So if you can get more bang for your buck by choosing players on the best teams, go for it. 

Secondly, in terms of bang for your buck, you are almost always better off choosing a top 5 player from a lower standing team, than a top 6 -10 player on a higher team. With exceptions to three top teams (MIC, LIV, TOT), the green bars are almost always below the yellow bars, meaning that the âCost / Priceâ ratio severely falls off outside of the top 5 players.

### Can We Buy Low & Sell High? 
As discussed earlier, the strategy in winning fantasy soccer lies in being able to pick the differential, or finding the low âCostâ players which provide the highest number of points. In trying to identify these bargain players, we wanted to see which players over the course of the season had their prices go up the most, and conversely, those whose prices went down the most. 

In all, there was far less movement in player âCostâ than anticipated. For the past three seasons, the top 10 highest âCostâ players at the beginning of the season were also the top 10 highest âCostâ players at the end of the season. Additionally, we found that about 75% of players have âCostsâ which vary less than +/- 200,000 over the course of the entire season. As such, we decided to graph the âCostsâ of players over the 2021 season whose price went up or down by 300,000 or more. 

On the first chart, we see soccer players that experienced a cumulative âCostâ decrease of 300k, or more, from their original pricing at any point during the season. As you might notice, there is a large drop in Week 1 for almost every player. For background, fantasy users choose their team during the summer, before any soccer games have been played. As such, soccer player âCostsâ when initially chosen are based on last yearâs performance. The large swing in âCostsâ in Week 1 can be interpreted as users reacting to the first week of games of the current season. 

For comparison sake, we colored the lines based on whether the playerâs Week 37 âCostâ (last game of the season) was greater than Week 1. In other words, whether the soccer playerâs valuation recovered from the initial jolt of their Week 1 performance. Interestingly enough, youâll notice that all players except for one (which came out neutral) were in fact valued higher at the end of the season.

In our view, the rising âCostsâ for a player signals that they were previously undervalued, or that the âCost / Pointsâ ratio was off relative to other players, and required correction. As such, picking a player on the upswing, at their lowest âCostâ point during the season, is directly equivalent to picking the player when they are most undervalued. Like stocks, we want to get in at the lowest point, and ride it to the top, which translates to the user theoretically benefiting from a lower than market rate âCost / Pointsâ ratio until the soccer playerâs âCostâ peaks.


```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(neg_vals, aes(x=Week, y=Cost, group = player_id, colour=factor(delta37_dummy))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3500000, 13500000), breaks = seq(3500000,20000000,500000), labels = label_number(suffix = " M", scale = 1e-6)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-0,37,1)) +
  geom_line(size=0.3, alpha=0.75) +
  geom_point(size=0.3, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 0) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(colour = "Weeks 1 vs 37") +
  ggtitle("Players Experiencing 300K or Greater \n Cumulitive Cost Decrease in 2021") +
  ylab("Cost in Week (Millions)") + xlab("Game Week") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("Increase" = "#009E73", "No Change" = "#CC79A7", "Decrease" = "#E69F00")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle=45))
```

What the graph above shows, is that the players which experienced large negative down valuations, pretty much all did so in Week 1, and ended up having an upward trajectory afterwards. Stated otherwise, pretty much every soccer player that produces fewer than expected points in Week 1 goes on fire sale.

On the other hand, the direct opposite was true among players which experienced a cumulative âCostâ increase of 300,000 or more from their original pricing at any point during the season. On the second graph, we see a very similar large shift in week 1 as fantasy users correct for the first week of games. However, an overwhelming majority of these players were valued lower in Week 37 than they were in Week 1. In other words, they were most overvalued in Week 1 and ultimately declined afterwards. 

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
ggplot(pos_vals, aes(x=Week, y=Cost, group = player_id, colour=factor(delta37_dummy))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3500000, 13500000), breaks = seq(3500000,20000000,500000), labels = label_number(suffix = "", scale = 1e-6)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,37,1)) +
  geom_line(size=0.3, alpha=0.75) +
  geom_point(size=0.3, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 0) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(colour = "Weeks 1 vs 37") +
  ggtitle("Players Experiencing 300K or Greater \n Cumulitive Cost Increase in 2021") +
  ylab("Cost in Week (Millions)") + xlab("Game Week") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("Increase" = "#009E73", "No Change" = "#CC79A7", "Decrease" = "#E69F00")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle=45))

# https://rdrr.io/cran/ggthemes/man/colorblind.html
```

In all we can confidently conclude that players who experience a large drop in âCostâ in Week 1 are almost certainly undervalued, while those experiencing a large increase in âCostâ are almost certainly overvalued. While it may seem unconventional, we thus recommend users go after the players with the largest âCostâ drops in Week 1, and avoid the players with âCostâ increases in Week 1.
