<p>Premier League Fantasy Football is a game where participants manage their own football (soccer) team, and compete with each other by comparing team performance. The real-life performance (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of active players from the participants’ team rosters are used to score points for the team in the game. Hence, the game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team.</p>
<p>While identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy managers, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research question – how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. To do so, we wish to explore correlations between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance metrics such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties. Along the way, we will answer questions, such as: Which positions score the most points? How do the most expensive players at the beginning of the season perform over time? Is there a cost-bias for players of similar performance on better teams? Do more expensive players always score the most points?</p>
<p>Before we dive deeper into the analysis of correlation between player cost and various performance metrics, we will first further debrief the game of Fantasy Premier League Football. When the participant first signs up to the game as a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) manager, the participant will be given a budget of 100 Pounds to spend on a roster of 15 players; of the 15 players, two are goalkeepers, five are defenders, five are midfielders, and three are forwards. The FPL manager must then create a team of 11 players of any formation, but must include at least one goalkeeper, three defenders, two midfielders, and one forward. Each Gameweek, the teams score points based on every player’s performance as measured in goals, assists, saves, clean sheets (not conceding goals), and more.</p>
<p>As one can quickly realize, every FPL manager is essentially optimizing their budget to get the players that they perceive are the best in performance to cost. The game is a trade off. If superstar players are picked, then less budget is left for other strong middle tier players. If the FPL manage is able to identify cheap middle tier players with high performance, or player who are rising stars in real life, then the FPL manager will be able to score more points than other FPL managers and win the game. Therefore, FPL managers with good understanding of the cost performance correlations could have an advantage in building their team, and this project will attempt to discovery correlations between between player cost and all performance parameters.</p>

<p>According the English Premier League’s Website, the official Premier League performance
data is collected and analyzed by Opta, a third party analytics company. The data
collection process is described below:</p>
<p>“Live data is collected by a three-person team covering each match. Two highly
trained analysts use a proprietary video-based collection system to gather
information on what happens every time a player touches the ball, which player
it was and where on the pitch the action occurred… a quality control analyst
has the ability to rewind the video feed frame-by-frame in order to make certain
that the information being distributed is as precise and consistent as possible.”
(<a href="https://www.premierleague.com/stats/clarification" class="uri">https://www.premierleague.com/stats/clarification</a>)</p>
<p>In hand, the EPL shares this data on their website. Given our project’s interest
lies in how player performance is translated into ‘fantasy points’, we plan to use
datasets publicly available on fantasyoverlord.com, as linked below:
<a href="http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/History" class="uri">http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/History</a>. The primary reason for using Fantasy
Overlord is that their data includes the EPL player performance data, as well as
fantasy player ‘costs’ and fantasy player point totals on a week by week basis,
which is not available on the EPL website. Additionally, the data set we’re using
also represents all information available to fantasy players.</p>
<p>For background, Fantasy Overlord is maintained by Fantasy Football enthusiasts,
attempting to forecast player fantasy performance. While we won’t be leveraging
the website’s models or predictions, Fantasy Overlord makes their data publicly
available on their site. On Fantasy Overlord’s “About” page, the website states
the player performance data is web scrapped directly from The Premier League’s
website, and is routinely updated every 30 minutes. The about page also indicates
how long ago the data was last scraped. As mentioned, Fantasy Overlord conveniently
combines the publicly available data on the EPL website, and the translated
fantasy point totals.</p>
<p>We believe our data is objective in the sense that no sampling and polls are performed.
As outlined above, the EPL has processes in place to ensure the performance data
they collect is as accurate as possible. Opta has no ulterior motive in
manipulating the data to demonstrate any political or financial claim. Fantasy
Overlord also holds incentives to ensure their data is correct, as errors in
data collection undermines their objective of providing accurate forecasts.</p>
<p>In the case that we found errors in the data, we could contact Fantasy Overlord using
the following methods:<br />
1) Raising the issue in the comments section of the website (<a href="http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/CommentsPage" class="uri">http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/CommentsPage</a>)<br />
2) Contacting their Twitter page to notify them of the issue (<a href="https://twitter.com/foverlord" class="uri">https://twitter.com/foverlord</a>)<br />
</p>
<p>Further, if the source of the error came from Opta, we could raise this issue through
their “Get In Touch” page (<a href="https://www.statsperform.com/contact/" class="uri">https://www.statsperform.com/contact/</a>). Hence, we are able
to contact our sources of data should there be doubt about accuracy.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Data File Format and Importing<a href="proposal.html#data-file-format-and-importing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Fantasy Overlord’s data is organized in CSV files by Game week, spanning the
full 2017 and 2021 seasons. Each Premier League season is composed of 38 match
weeks, during which each of the 20 teams play one game. As such, “Games” among
fantasy players occur over the course of a full week, ensuring that all players
on a fantasy roster record a performance which translates to points.</p>
<p>As such, the data in one match week file captures the player points applicable in
one fantasy game, for all players in the league. For this project, we will be
aggregating the 38 match weeks across 5 seasons, for a total of 190 match weeks
of data. Our plan is download all of the CSV files, and compile them into data sets
by year, for which the performance of each player for each game week is one observation,
and variables will record key performance metrics. From there, we will aggregate
player statistics based on the given analysis question at hand. Since the data fields
are consistent across CSV files, appending the data and labeling the match week &amp;
year of the appended data should be achievable.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Data Fields Available<a href="proposal.html#data-fields-available" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The CSV files contains basic player attributes such as: Name, Position, and Team.
Player performance metrics include Total Points, Assists, Minutes Played, Goals Scored,
Yellow Cards, Red Cards, and Clean Sheets. Player cost metrics include Cost,
Total Points Per Dollar, Average Points Per Dollar, and Price Change From Previous Week.
Lastly, player point metrics include Points Last Round, Total Points, and Average Points
Per Week.</p>
<p>Additionally, there a number of fields capturing the performance of goalies, however
we are choosing to exclude the position from our analysis as the evaluation metrics
are completely separate from all other player positions.</p>
