Premier League Fantasy Football is a game where the participant is casted into a manager role of their own football (soccer) team, and the participant can draft players and compete against friends and strangers by comparing team performance. The real-life performance (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of that of the active players from the participants’ team rosters are used to score points for the team in the game. Each player on the team roaster costs X pounds to own, and participants have fixed budgets to select what the participants perceive to be the best players. The game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team. Whereas identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy players, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research questions – how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. Furthermore, we wish to explorer what the correlations are between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance parameters such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties.
