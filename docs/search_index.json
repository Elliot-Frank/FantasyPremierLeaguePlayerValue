It is a game where the participants build and manage their own Premier League team. Each week participants compete by comparing their team’s performance with each other. The real-life performances (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of Premier League players who are selected in the participants’ roster are used to score points for the participants’ team. The game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team. An extra dimension to this game is the fact that players cost X pounds to own, and participants have fixed budgets to build a team. Therefore, building a team in Fantasy Premier may be viewed as an optimization problem in which participants attempt to maximize the points their team scores by selecting “value for money” players. In other words, while identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy managers, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research question – how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. To do so, we wish to explorer what the correlations are between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance parameters such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties.
