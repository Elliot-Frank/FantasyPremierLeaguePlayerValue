It is a game where the participants build and manage their own Premier League team. Each week participants compete by comparing their teams performance with each other. The real-life performances (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of Premier League players who are selected in the participants roster are used to score points for the participants team. The game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team. An extra dimension to this game is the fact that players cost X pounds to own, and participants have fixed budgets to build a team. Therefore, building a team in Fantasy Premier may be viewed as an optimization problem in which participants attempt to maximize the points their team scores by selecting value for money players. In other words, while identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy managers, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research question  how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. To do so, we wish to explorer what the correlations are between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance parameters such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Premier League Fantasy Football is a game where participants manage their own football (soccer) team, and compete with each other by comparing team performance. The real-life performance (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of active players from the participants team rosters are used to score points for the team in the game. Hence, the game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team. While identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy managers, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research question  how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. To do so, we wish to explore correlations between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance metrics such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties. Along the way, we will answer questions, such as: Which positions score the most points? How do the most expensive players at the beginning of the season perform over time? Is there a cost-bias for players of similar performance on better teams? Do more expensive players always score the most points? Before we dive deeper into the analysis of correlation between player cost and various performance metrics, we will first further debrief the game of Fantasy Premier League Football. When the participant first signs up to the game as a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) manager, the participant will be given a budget of 100 Pounds to spend on a roster of 15 players; of the 15 players, two are goalkeepers, five are defenders, five are midfielders, and three are forwards. The FPL manager must then create a team of 11 players of any formation, but must include at least one goalkeeper, three defenders, two midfielders, and one forward. Each Gameweek, the teams score points based on every players performance as measured in goals, assists, saves, clean sheets (not conceding goals), and more. As one can quickly realize, every FPL manager is essentially optimizing their budget to get the players that they perceive are the best in performance to cost. The game is a trade off. If superstar players are picked, then less budget is left for other strong middle tier players. If the FPL manage is able to identify cheap middle tier players with high performance, or player who are rising stars in real life, then the FPL manager will be able to score more points than other FPL managers and win the game. Therefore, FPL managers with good understanding of the cost performance correlations could have an advantage in building their team, and this project will attempt to discovery correlations between between player cost and all performance parameters. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 Date Source According the English Premier Leagues Website, the official Premier League performance data is collected and analyzed by Opta, a third party analytics company. The data collection process is described below: Live data is collected by a three-person team covering each match. Two highly trained analysts use a proprietary video-based collection system to gather information on what happens every time a player touches the ball, which player it was and where on the pitch the action occurred a quality control analyst has the ability to rewind the video feed frame-by-frame in order to make certain that the information being distributed is as precise and consistent as possible. (https://www.premierleague.com/stats/clarification) In hand, the EPL shares this data on their website. Given our projects interest lies in how player performance is translated into fantasy points, we plan to use datasets publicly available on fantasyoverlord.com, as linked below: http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/History. The primary reason for using Fantasy Overlord is that their data includes the EPL player performance data, as well as fantasy player costs and fantasy player point totals on a week by week basis, which is not available on the EPL website. Additionally, the data set were using also represents all information available to fantasy players. For background, Fantasy Overlord is maintained by Fantasy Football enthusiasts, attempting to forecast player fantasy performance. While we wont be leveraging the websites models or predictions, Fantasy Overlord makes their data publicly available on their site. On Fantasy Overlords About page, the website states the player performance data is web scrapped directly from The Premier Leagues website, and is routinely updated every 30 minutes. The about page also indicates how long ago the data was last scraped. As mentioned, Fantasy Overlord conveniently combines the publicly available data on the EPL website, and the translated fantasy point totals. We believe our data is objective in the sense that no sampling and polls are performed. As outlined above, the EPL has processes in place to ensure the performance data they collect is as accurate as possible. Opta has no ulterior motive in manipulating the data to demonstrate any political or financial claim. Fantasy Overlord also holds incentives to ensure their data is correct, as errors in data collection undermines their objective of providing accurate forecasts. In the case that we found errors in the data, we could contact Fantasy Overlord using the following methods: 1) Raising the issue in the comments section of the website (http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/CommentsPage) 2) Contacting their Twitter page to notify them of the issue (https://twitter.com/foverlord) Further, if the source of the error came from Opta, we could raise this issue through their Get In Touch page (https://www.statsperform.com/contact/). Hence, we are able to contact our sources of data should there be doubt about accuracy. 2.2.2 Data File Format and Importing Fantasy Overlords data is organized in CSV files by Game week, spanning the full 2017 and 2021 seasons. Each Premier League season is composed of 38 match weeks, during which each of the 20 teams play one game. As such, Games among fantasy players occur over the course of a full week, ensuring that all players on a fantasy roster record a performance which translates to points. As such, the data in one match week file captures the player points applicable in one fantasy game, for all players in the league. For this project, we will be aggregating the 38 match weeks across 5 seasons, for a total of 190 match weeks of data. Our plan is download all of the CSV files, and compile them into data sets by year, for which the performance of each player for each game week is one observation, and variables will record key performance metrics. From there, we will aggregate player statistics based on the given analysis question at hand. Since the data fields are consistent across CSV files, appending the data and labeling the match week &amp; year of the appended data should be achievable. 2.2.3 Data Fields Available The CSV files contains basic player attributes such as: Name, Position, and Team. Player performance metrics include Total Points, Assists, Minutes Played, Goals Scored, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, and Clean Sheets. Player cost metrics include Cost, Total Points Per Dollar, Average Points Per Dollar, and Price Change From Previous Week. Lastly, player point metrics include Points Last Round, Total Points, and Average Points Per Week. Additionally, there a number of fields capturing the performance of goalies, however we are choosing to exclude the position from our analysis as the evaluation metrics are completely separate from all other player positions. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Source: http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/History Season stats for 2016 to 2021 season 3.2 Cleaning / transformation The code we used for data cleaning and transformation can be seen in the combine_data.Rmd file. Our data for each season is parsed across one file for each week, as such the first step in our transformation process was to compile all of the weeks and seasons into one dataset. The `import_columns list shows the variables from each weekly data set that we compiled. In lines 32-47, we loop through each file, retain the desired columns, and append the observations to a master dataframe. From the filename of each weekly data set, we added a match week (Week) column, as well as distinguished the season (Year). Lastly, we converted fields from strings to numerics for later calculations. 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Player Value Using Total Points &amp; Cost 4.2 Player Value over Time 4.3 Correlation Between Cost &amp; Selected By Percentage", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Player Value Using Total Points &amp; Cost The first way we approached the task of determining whether a soccer player is overvalued or undervalued was by looking at how many fantasy points a soccer player received in a season, how much the players cost and the ratio of the two. In our analysis, we regard undervalued soccer players as having high total points in a season and a low cost. Conversely, we define overvalued soccer players as having low total points in a season compared to their price. 4.1.1 Filtering Out Bench Players Before we get started with this analysis, it is important to highlight the fact that we filtered out players who average less than 45 minutes of play time per game. We made this cut because we only wanted to consider players who are on the pitch for more than half of the game on average (a soccer match lasts 90 minutes). In the plot below, we see can see where this cutoff. While it appears that we are filtering out most of soccer players in the league, we want to emphasize that the players we are cutting have little value for our analysis because if they are averaging less than 45 minutes of game time, they are most certainly bench players or injured players. These type of players be of much value because they simply do not spend enough time playing on the pitch, which justifies our choice to cut them from the analysis. 4.1.2 Vizualizing The Problem To understand relationship between the total points scored in a season and the soccer player cost, we have produced a scatter plot of the two variables. As can be seen from the graph, there is a positive correlation between total points and soccer player cost. This is expected as soccer players who score more points are more valuable, hence their cost should increase. However, there are large deviations from the correlation shown in the best fit line. If a soccer player lies above the best fit line, it shows that they have a high points per cost output and consequently are undervalued. Likewise, if a player lies below the best fit line, they have a low points per cost output and are overvalued. Therefore, moving forward our analysis will investigate if there are patterns which lead to players being above or below this best fit line. In the graph, there is no clear trend showing that the number of points a player scores in a season depends on the year. In other words, in further analysis we may assume that soccer player performance statistics are time-independent. Further, it must be noted that the 2019 analysis has been excluded from the plot as the final week of the season was missing from the data source (as discussed in the missing data analysis). A final point to add about the graph is the fact that the best fit line, calculated using a loess smoothing, shows the gradient is steeper before £6 million and shallower after. This indicates that there could be an element of diminishing reuturns of value when choosing more expensive soccer players. 4.1.3 Player Value By Position Taking a more granular perspective, we divided the players into their 3 position categories: defenders (DEF), midfielders (MID) and forwards (FWD). We then investigated how the total points, player cost and ratio of the two varied by position. In the next graph, we see boxplots of total points, cost and points per cost for each position. In the boxplot of total points we see that forwards generally score the most points and defenders score the least, indicating that forwards are the most valuable and defenders the least. However, when looking at the cost boxplot, we see that defenders cost the least and forwards cost the most, suggesting that defenders could have the best value for money. In the third boxplot, we divide the total points by cost and find that these two opposing effects essentially cancel out as the median points per cost is roughly 18 points per million of pounds. Interestingly, we also notice that the variation of points per cost is largest for defenders and smallest for forwards. This implies that when choosing forwards, there is a smaller risk of the soccer player being overvalued and a smaller reward for the player being undervalued, while the reverse is true for defenders who have a larger risk and larger reward. 4.1.3.1 Key Indicators of Player Value By Position How Different Players Score Points From our analysis so far, we have found that the median point per cost does not vary much across position. We have also found that forwards are less likely to be undervalued but also less likely to be overvalues, while it is the opposite for defenders. With this in mind, our next question looks to identify what traits one should look for when determining the value of defenders, midfielders and forwards. In the parallel coordinates plot, we see that there are 3 distinct clusters for how soccer players score points and these clusters follow position categories. With defenders, we see that they score few points from goals and assists, but a lot of points from having clean sheets (a clean sheet occurs when a team does not concede a goal during a game). Looking at midfielders and forwards, we see that most of their points come from goals and assists. Moreover, in terms of clean sheets for midfielders, they get relatively few and for forwards they get zero points from clean sheets (which is explained as forwards cannot score points from clean sheets). Focusing on bonus points, we have no evidence suggesting that certain positions score more bonus points than others. This leads us to the conclusion that it is best to evaluate defenders based on clean sheets, while we should judge midfielders and forwards based on goals and assists. An interesting point to note is that the soccer players with the most points from goals scored are midfielders, differing from the expectation that forwards score the most points from goals. One explanation for this could be that when a forward scores a goal they receive 4 points, while midfielders receive 5. However, deeper analysis reveals that these midfield players are Salah, Mane and Son. It could be argued that these soccer players should be classified as forwards because they sometimes play the striker position. Hence, one could conclude that these top scoring players in terms of points from goals occur because the players are misclassified as midfielders rather than strikers and therefore receive 5 points per goal rather than 4. This indicates that a strategy to pick undervalued players is to pick players like Salah, Mane and Son who play as wingers/strikers but are classified as midfielders in the FPL game. Why Selected By Percentage is Important Selected By Percentage describes the proportion of FPL users that have selected a certain soccer player in their team. For example, if the Selected By Percentage is 10% for soccer player X, this means that 10% of FPL users have chosen soccer player X for their team. To illustrate why this statistic is important, lets now assume player X has a Selected By Percentage of 95%. Whenever soccer player X plays, 95% of FPL players will receive the points player X scores. This reduces the value of picking player X in your team because whenever player X scores points, 95% of FPL players will benefit from these points. Therefore, a useful strategy to implement when building an FPL team is to try to choose soccer players with a low Selected By Percentage because if these soccer players score a lot of points, fewer FPL users will benefit from these points. As can be seen in the relative frequency histogram faceted by position, most soccer players have a Selected By Percentage of less than 20%, which is low. Therefore, in future analysis we do not have to worry about players having a high Selected By Percentage, which would reduce their value. Another thing to note in this graph is the fact that the majority of soccer players are defenders and midfielders, not forwards. This difference can be explained with the knowledge that a typical soccer lineup is 4-4-2, which means the team fields 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 forwards. Hence, we would expect there to be more defenders and midfielders than forwards in the dataset, as soccer lineups use more defenders and midfielders. 4.1.4 Player Value By Team In recent soccer history, the premier league has been dominated by a group of teams referred to as The Big Six. The teams in The Big Six are Manchester City (MCI), Liverpool (LIV), Chelsea (CHE), Tottenham (TOT), Arsenal (ARS), and Manchester United (MUN). These teams all have global name recognition, with millions of fans around the world, leading to huge payroll budgets. According to The Athletic, Manchester City will spend £430 million in the 2022-2023 season paying its players, followed by Chelsea (£343 million), Manchester United (£323 million), Liverpool (£314 million), Arsenal (£244 million), and Tottenham (£205 million). Meanwhile, the bottom tier teams payroll budgets tend to hover between £10 - £50 million. With such market power to attract the best soccer talent, these teams use their deep pockets to stay at the top of the leaderboard. Unsurprisingly, the best players are concentrated on these six teams. Given Cost in FPL is driven by performance, its no surprise that the highest Cost players in the FPL game are concentrated within the The Big Six teams. In the ridge graph above, we plotted the distribution of soccer player cost in FPL in the last week of the 2017 - 2021 seasons, as Cost in the last week reflects the players performance over the course of the entire season. For clarity, we ordered the teams in the ridge graph by their record at the end of the 2021 season, with MCI finishing in first, and BUR finishing at the bottom. An important feature of the English Premier League is that the worst three teams are kicked out at the end of the season. So, while the top teams are competing to win the league, the bottom teams are fighting to avoid being demoted. For consistency, we chose to include only the teams which played in the league every year between 2017 and 2021. What we see in the graph is reflective of reality, that the soccer players on the bottom of the bottom teams are mostly concentrated around a mean of £4-5 million, but as you climb up the board, the mean shifts to between £5-6 million, and the tails get longer and longer. In fact, the top performing teams appear to have multi-modal distributions in which subsets of their are very expensive. Using the previous analysis that the the best soccer players cost the most, this follows the claim that the best performing soccer teams have the best performing soccer players. Overall, we see that there is a clear association between teams with higher records and Cost of soccer players on those teams. Given the winning teams are those that score more a lot of goals and do not concede many, its not surprising that fantasy points, and thus Cost are concentrated on those teams. https://theathletic.com/3476123/2022/08/10/premier-league-wages-growth-tax-top-earners/ How about Cost per Point for Teams? While the previous ridge line plot clearly indicates that players on better teams Cost more in FPL, we want to ask the question Is the higher cost of players on winning teams justified in terms of producing fantasy points? To find an answer, we grouped the 5 highest scoring soccer players (in terms of points) on each team in the 2021 season, and divided their Cost by the total number of fantasy points they received in the bar chart below. Next, we did the same thing with each teams 6 to 10th highest scoring soccer players (in terms of points). Lastly, the teams are ordered from left to right in the place the team finished the 2021 season. In looking at the Cost/Point ratio among top 5 players (the green bars), most teams range around 1.5-2.5 million pounds per point. Seeing that these bars are pretty consistent across the top and middle of the pack, we conclude that FPL users generally arent willing to pay disproportionate Costs for players on a Big Six team. Of course, there are a few major exceptions, which we find are the most interesting parts of the graph. Compared to its peers, Manchester Uniteds (MUN) Cost/Points ratio is higher than any other team in the league. In examining the data, we found that this is largely driven by the under performance of its key star players. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo was traded to Manchester United last year, and was expected to make a huge impact. At 37 years old, and in his 20th season of playing professional soccer, he failed to perform as highly as expected. As such, his Cost was extremely high all season, but he produced few fantasy points to show for it. When looking at the top 5 players in each team, we believe the higher Cost/Points ratio teams indicate those which under performed in the league relative to expectations. All 4 teams whose Top 5 player Cost/Points ratio exceeded 2.5 million (MUN, LEI, EVE, BUR), were expected to place higher than they did given their record in 2020 and the real life salary budget at the clubs disposal. From this graph, we conclude two recommendations to users. First, there doesnt appear to be a premium on Cost/Points for players on better teams. So if you can get more bang for your buck by choosing players on the best teams, go for it. Secondly, in terms of bang for your buck, you are almost always better off choosing a top 5 player from a lower standing team, than a top 6-10 player on a higher team. With exceptions to three top teams (MIC, LIV, TOT), the green bars are almost always below the yellow bars, meaning that the Cost/Price ratio severely falls off outside of the top 5 players. 4.2 Player Value over Time Rather than only looking at whether a soccer player is undervalued or overvalued compared to other soccer players in the league, we decided to also investigate whether a soccer player is undervalued or overvalued at a particular instant in time across the season. 4.2.1 Predicting When Players Score The Most Points To start this analysis, we plotted a raster plot of the number of points scored each week by each soccer player in 2021. Our hypothesis was that this plot would patterns where in certain weeks lots of soccer players would score a lot of points. For example, perhaps over the Christmas period lots of players would score goals and hence score points. However, when looking at the plot there is no clear correlation between soccer players scoring points in a given week. The only weak conclusion we can make is that few points were consistently scored by soccer players in Weeks 25, 26 and 29. There are two things to note in this graph: firstly, a color scale cut off was imposed at 10 points in an attempt to highlight trends; however, even with this cut off, there is no obvious pattern. Secondly, it is worth mentioning that a lot of advanced analytics and machine learning projects are currently investigating the challenge of predicting when soccer players will score a lot of points in FPL. If the reader is interested in this ML analysis, we suggest researching the following links: FPL Forum Predictions and an FPL Data Anlytics Paper. 4.2.2 Can We Buy Low &amp; Sell High? As discussed earlier, the strategy in winning FPL lies in being able to find the low Cost players which provide the highest number of points. In trying to identify these bargain players, we wanted to see which soccer players over the course of the season had their prices go up the most, and conversely, those whose prices went down the most. In all, there was far less movement in player Cost than anticipated. For the past three seasons, the top 10 highest Cost players at the beginning of the season were also the top 10 highest Cost players at the end of the season, indicating that player costs to not vary too much. Qunatifying this, we found that about 75% of players have Costs which vary less than +/- £200,000 over the course of the entire season. As such, we decided to graph the Costs of players over the 2021 season whose price went up or down by £300,000 or more. On the first chart, we see soccer players that experienced a cumulative Cost decrease of £300k, or more, from their original pricing at any point during the season. As you might notice, there is a large drop in Week 1 for almost every player. For background research, FPL users choose their team during the summer, before any soccer games have been played. As such, soccer player Costs when initially chosen are based on last years performance. The large swing in Costs in Week 1 can be interpreted as users reacting to the first week of games of the current season. For comparison sake, we colored the lines based on whether the soccer players Week 37 Cost (last game of the season) was greater than Week 1. In other words, whether the soccer players valuation recovered from the initial jolt of their Week 1 performance. Interestingly enough, youll notice that all players except for one (which came out neutral) were in fact valued higher at the end of the season. In our view, the rising Costs for a player signals that they were previously undervalued, or that the Cost/Points ratio was off relative to other players, and required correction. As such, picking a player on the upswing, at their lowest Cost point during the season, is directly equivalent to picking the player when they are most undervalued. Like stocks, we want to get in at the lowest point, and ride it to the top, which translates to the user theoretically benefiting from a lower than market rate Cost/Point ratio until the soccer players Cost peaks. What the graph above shows, is that the players which experienced large negative down valuations, pretty much all did so in Week 1, and ended up having an upward trajectory afterwards. Stated otherwise, pretty much every soccer player that produces fewer than expected points in Week 1 goes on fire sale. On the other hand, the direct opposite was true among players which experienced a cumulative Cost increase of £300k or more from their original pricing at any point during the season. On the second graph, we see a very similar large shift in week 1 as fantasy users correct for the first week of games. However, an overwhelming majority of these players were valued lower in Week 37 than they were in Week 1. In other words, they were most overvalued in Week 1 and ultimately declined afterwards. In all we can confidently conclude that players who experience a large drop in Cost in Week 1 are almost certainly undervalued, while those experiencing a large increase in Cost are almost certainly overvalued. While it may seem unconventional, we thus recommend users go after the players with the largest Cost drops in Week 1, and avoid the players with Cost increases in Week 1. 4.3 Correlation Between Cost &amp; Selected By Percentage Another angle we approached the project question from was trying to find a pattern with Selected By Percentage because if we find soccer players that arent picked by many FPL users, we could benefit more from their points. From our research, we found that Selected By Percentage is a driver of player cost. For example, if a lot of FPL users choose a soccer player, his demand is high, so his Cost increases. Therefore, we decided to plot a scatter plot of total points against Selected By Percentage to explore any potential trends. However, as can be seen in the graph, there is no obvious pattern in the data. However, when plotting the weekly change in cost of the top 7 most expensive players in FPL during 2021 next to the weekly Selected By Percentage of these soccer players by FPL users, we see evidence of correlations between the two. For example, in Week 23 we see the Cost and Selected By Percentage of dip, while we see a peak for Ronaldo. With this in mind, one avenue of further work could look into the correlation between total points and Selected By Percentage because we know there is a positive correlation between total points and cost and there may be another positive correlation between cost and Selected By Percentage. Therefore, an indicator for player value could be a ratio between Selected By Percentage and Total Points "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Click Here To See Vizualization "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
