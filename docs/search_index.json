Premier League Fantasy Football is a game where the participants is casted into a manager role of his or her own football (soccer) team, and the participant can draft players and compete against friends and strangers by comparing team performance. The real-life performance (goals, saves, assists, etc.) of that of the active players from the participants’ team rosters are used to score points for the team in the game. Each player on the team roaster costs X pounds to own, and participants have fixed budgets to select what the participants perceive to be the best players. The game is a combination of strategy and luck, which provides a simulated experience of managing a professional sports team. Whereas identifying the top players is obvious to fantasy players, the skill lies in evaluating middle tier players, and identifying up-and-coming talent in the league. As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research questions – how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. Furthermore, we wish to explorer what the correlations are between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance parameters such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties.

As such, the crux of the game is also that of our research questions – how can one identify whether a given player is overvalued or undervalued in fantasy football. Furthermore, we wish to explorer what the correlations are between player cost, player position, minutes played, and various performance parameters such as goals, saves, assists, and penalties. Along the way, we are curious about questions like: Which positions score the most points? How do the most expensive players at the beginning of of the season perform over time? Is there a cost-bias for players of similar performance on better teams? Do more expensive players always score the most points? Before we dive deeper into the analysis of correlation between player cost and various performance parameters, we will first further debrief the game of Fantasy Premier League Football. When the participant first signs up to the game as a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) manager, the participant will be given a budget of 100 Pounds to spend on a roster of 15 players; of the 15 players, two are goalkeepers, five are defenders, five are midfielders, and three are forwards. The FPL manager must then create a team of 11 players of any formation, but must include at least one goalkeeper, three defenders, two midfielders, and one forward. Each Gameweek, the teams score points based on every player’s performance as measured in goals, assists, saves, and clean sheets (not conceding goals while playing for more than 60 minutes). As one can quickly realize, every FPL manager is essentially optimizing their budget to get the players that they perceive are the best in performance to cost. The game is a trade off. If superstar players are picked, then less budget is left for other strong middle tier players. If the FPL manage is able to identify cheap middle tier players with high performance, or player who are rising stars in real life, then the FPL manager will be able to score more points than other FPL managers and win the game. Therefore, FPL managers with good understanding of the cost performance correlations could have an advantage in building their team, and this project will attempt to discovery correlations between between player cost and all performance parameters. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 Date Source According the English Premier League’s Website, the official Premier League performance data is collected and analyzed by Opta, a third party analytics company. The data collection process is described below: “Live data is collected by a three-person team covering each match. Two highly trained analysts use a proprietary video-based collection system to gather information on what happens every time a player touches the ball, which player it was and where on the pitch the action occurred… a quality control analyst has the ability to rewind the video feed frame-by-frame in order to make certain that the information being distributed is as precise and consistent as possible.” (https://www.premierleague.com/stats/clarification) In hand, the EPL shares this data on their website. Given our project’s interest lies in how player performance is translated into ‘fantasy points’, we plan to use datasets publicly available on fantasyoverlord.com, as linked below: http://fantasyoverlord.com/FPL/History. The primary reason for using Fantasy Overlord is that their data includes the EPL player performance data, as well as fantasy player ‘costs’ and fantasy player point totals, which are not on the EPL website. Additionally, the data set we’re using also represents all information available to fantasy players. For background, Fantasy Overlord is maintained by Fantasy Football enthusiasts, attempting to forecast player fantasy performance. While we won’t be leveraging the website’s models or predictions, Fantasy Overlord makes their data publicly available on their site. On Fantasy Overlord’s “About” page, the website states the player performance data is web scrapped directly from The Premier League’s website, and is routinely updated every 30 minutes. The about page also indicates how long ago the data was last scraped. As mentioned, Fantasy Overlord conveniently combines the publicly available data on the EPL website, and the translated fantasy point totals. We believe our data is objective in the sense that no sampling and polls are performed. As outlined above, the EPL has processes in place to ensure the performance data they collect is as accurate as possible. Opta has no ulterior motive in manipulating the data to demonstrate any political or financial claim. Fantasy Overlord also holds incentives to ensure their data is correct, as errors in data collection undermines their objective of providing accurate forecasts. 2.2.2 Data File Format and Importing Fantasy Overlord’s data is organized in CSV files by Game week, spanning the full 2017 and 2021 seasons. Each Premiere League season is composed of 38 match weeks, during which each of the 20 teams play one game. As such, “Games” among fantasy players occur over the course of a full week, ensuring that all players on a fantasy roster record a performance which translates to points. As such, the data in one match week file captures the player points applicable in one fantasy game, for all players in the league. For this project, we will be aggregating the 38 match weeks across 5 seasons, for a total of 190 match weeks of data. Our plan is download all of the CSV files, and compile them into data sets by year, for which each player is one observation, and variables will have key metrics for each week. From there, we will aggregate player statistics based on the given analysis question at hand. Since the data fields are consistent across CSV files, appending the data and labeling the match week &amp; year of the appended data should be achievable. 2.2.3 Data Fields Available The CSV files contains basic player attributes such as: Name, Position, and Team. Player performance metrics include Total Points, Assists, Minutes Played, Goals Scored, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, and Clean Sheets. Player cost metrics include Cost, Total Points Per Dollar, Average Points Per Dollar, and Price Change From Previous Week. Lastly, player point metrics include Points Last Round, Total Points, and Average Points Per Week. Additionally, there a number of fields capturing the performance of goalies, however we are choosing to exclude the position from our analysis as the evaluation metrics are completely separate from all other player positions.
